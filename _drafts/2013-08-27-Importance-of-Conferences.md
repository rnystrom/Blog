title: On the Importance of Conferences
---
This weekend I had the pleasure of attending a conference in Ottawa, Canada called [NSNorth](http://nsnorth.ca). The conference was relatively small, being capped at 100 attendees. Prices were a little higher to facilitate a weekend free of sponsors and recruiters. It also likely ensured that only people serious about the industry attend. Two wonderful people, [Dan Byers](LINK GOES HERE) and (Philipe LAST NAME)[LINK GOES HERE], did all of the legwork setting up the event and deserve the utmost respect and praise for gathering all of the resources to put it on.

NSNorth was the first time I really stepped foot into Canada. Aside from seeing Niagara Falls, I really hadn't found a need to travel up north. This was also the first Cocoa-only conference that I had attended, not to mention one of only four tech conferences I've been to in my life.

The weekend resulted in a newly found sense of humanity in iOS and Mac development world. Meeting all of these wonderful people who have populated my RSS feeds for the past couple years gave me a realization that we are all **people** making software for  **people**. There was [Ash Furrow](LINK GOES HERE), [Gus Mueller](LINK GOES HERE), [Sam Vermette](LINK GOES HERE), [Rob Rhine SPELLING](LINK GOES HERE), and many more. People that I respect and look up to for guidance in the Apple world, all sharing stories over a pint or two.

I especially enjoyed my chats with [Jason Brennan](LINK GOES HERE) from the New York Times. He's just a bit younger than I am but already finding himself at the forefront of Cocoa development. Jason is not only smart and talented, but  charismatic and a hell of a listener. It's people like Jason that inspire me to further push my capabilities in this field and to encourage others to do so as well.

The camaraderie within the community this weekend was also amazing. Speakers were greeted with applause, developers at larger corporations dined with independents, and I was able to have a delightful conversation with [Guy English](http://kickingbear.com). We shared stories about apps we've created, about our project methodology, and more. I saw people sifting through source code, trying to help each other fix bugs.

At the end of it all, NSNorth filled me with even more passion and joy about my craft by exposing me to other smarter, and more passionate developers making amazing software. It is incredibly humbling to be able to sit and just listen to how other developers create and iterate their work.

Conferences, especially the smaller ones, are an incredible opportunity to expose yourself to people better at your craft than you are but are also extremely willing to extend their knowledge and answer any questions you might have. I strongly encourage everyone to give a small conference a shot.
