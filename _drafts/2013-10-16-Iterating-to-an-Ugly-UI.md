title: Iterating to an Ugly UI
---

- explain golf app constraints
- course view
	- holes
	- branding
	- total yardage
	- par
	- course title
- start w/ drawings
- go to dribble, search "iOS 7 list", table, etc
- explain each iteration
- interactions & animations
- throw it all away and focus utility
- sunlight is a factor (high contrast, black on white)
- animations waste time, nothing to load/veil
- more information on screen in hierarchy (hole order matters)
- circle touches on course hole signs (color + border + typeface)
- include hole info that matters holistically (#, handicap, par)
- branding shows imagery but doesn't take too much space
- yardage is holistic info
- remember state of last viewed hole
- dribbblization of design hurts usability
	- focus on designing for utility, not just to be shiny
