    <p>I ran into a pretty interesting problem last week. I was working on an AI for my senior thesis (its an iOS game), and I wanted it done in python to be able to test it out on any machine before porting it over to Objective C (though it'll likely be done in C for speed reasons). The algorithm used a <em>lot</em> of recursion. I basically did the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find all possible states of the game

<ul>
<li>13 dice, 5 possible rolls (one side was repeated twice) which yields 2380 combinations <strong>for the first roll</strong></li>
<li>Gather the possible decisions from each roll (collect a certain face of die, remove from bag)</li>
<li>Find all possible states of remaining die</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When at an end state for a turn, return the collected points</li>
<li>Average the number of points for each decision

<ul>
<li>The highest average is the <em>best</em> action to take</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>This entire process meant that I had to find the score for roughly 7 * 10<sup>31</sup> outcomes of the game. However, not all of these outcomes are unique. There are multiple ways to score 5 points. There are also multiple ways to roll 5 rays, 2 tanks, 0 cows, 2 chickens, and 0 humans. Using a raw computation of each state took about 1.5 minutes to find a solution when starting with 10-11 dice (13 dice took far too long for my level of patience). I needed to find a faster solution, especially since there are repeated states.</p>

<h3>Memoization</h3>

<p>I needed to build a cache object in Python. The memory footprint wasn't going to be huge, even with 7 * 10<sup>31</sup> states. A lot of those states are repitions, and each state only needs to hold an integer value from the range 0 to 16 (16 is the maximum possible score for one turn). The solution I came up with is a form of Memoization. I created a dictionary and added keys and values based on the parameters of the function that I was recursing. The function looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>def getAvgPoints(num_remaining, tanks, rays, humans, chickens, cows ):
    if num_remaining == 0:
        if ( ... ):
            return 0
        else:
            return humans + chickens + cows + (3 if humans &gt; 0 and chickens &gt; 0 and cows &gt; 0 else 0 )   
    ...
    // get all combinations
    // recursively get their scores, calling getAvgPoints( ... )
    ...
    return score
</code></pre>

<p>To cache these values and avoid repeated calculations, I added this to the beginning of the function:</p>

<pre><code>cache = {}
def getAvgPoints(num_remaining, tanks, rays, humans, chickens, cows ):
    key = '%s-%s-%s-%s-%s-%s' % (num_remaining, tanks, rays, humans, chickens, cows )
        if cache.get(key):
            return cache.get(key)
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>And that's it. Now, if I've already figured out the score for a certain number of remaining and collected dice, I skip all of the nitty-gritty and just return the score which saves tons of time. Time spent calculating went from about 1-1.5 minutes to <strong>1-3 seconds</strong>.</p>

<p>My professor, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/proffreda">Dr. Fred Annexstein</a>, told me that this was a strategy called <em>Memoization</em>. After a bit of digging, I can confirm this is exactly what I did. Sure I didn't discover something new, but it does feel great having found the solution myself. The algorithm is fast, damn fast, for what is being computed.</p>

<p>Now how to implement all of this into a real-time game AI.</p>
