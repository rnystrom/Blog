title: "My C++ Update"
---

It's been well over two years since I've written any C++. Yesterday I decided to jump [into a new book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596804831.do) on 3d programming for the iPhone. I know there are tons of engines and SDKs out there that can do 3d on iOS pretty well, but I'm not really concerned with making a 3d game at the moment. Honestly, I just want to dust off my C++ skills and apply them to these devices that have been captivating me.

Well its C++ Day 2 and I've got to say... this is pretty damn easy. I remember C++ being the most horrid and frustrating language ever. When I found Javascript or PHP I was oogling over how *simple* and *easy* the languages were to comprehend (let's not even get started on Python!). C++ just seemed tedious. 

Well that's not the case anymore. C++ is a pretty verbose language. Lots of little steps that other languages make second nature. But the beauty of that is the *freedom* that C++ gives you to do anything that you want. Sure, I wrote accessors when I probably didn't need to, my header files are redundantly long... but I have so much control over my objects that it is sickening.

Now this is not for the fient of heart. I've been doing Objective-C pretty extensively for the past year, so the syntax is nothing new. Using the OpenGL ES (and don't get me started on 1.1 vs 2.0) has been a bit frustrating. I'm not writing anything of my own yet. Just going through the motions of displaying 3d objects and interacting with them.

I think this is a good thing for me. If I don't make anything out of this adventure I wont be disappointed. My math and OOP skills have been improving vastly with Objective-C and this is only going to strengthen it further.
