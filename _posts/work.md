My Work
============

## Hiring Me

If you've landed here I can only imagine you are looking to add someone to your team. Let me tell you a little about what I'm really good at, what I like doing, and how I do it. For the past several years I have been focusing heavily on **web** and **iOS** development while dabbling in **mobile games**. I am a proponent of **agile** development strategies and stick to a strick regimen of **git** versioning. While I've built a strong understanding of mobile and web technologies, I can adopt new languages and frameworks whenever the task requires it. Please [download a copy](/media/ryannystrom-resume.pdf) of my CV for a professional overview. I'm also trying to push more open source work on [my github](http://github.com/rnystrom) account, so feel free to watch that as well.

### [RNExpandingButtonBar](https://github.com/rnystrom/RNExpandingButtonBar)
This is a simple and lightweight iOS widget that mimics the famous Path 2.0 button. I love the simplicity of the design and wanted something that I, and others, could drag and drop into their projects. It also needed to be highly customizable and *not* do most of the legwork for you. I find that a lot of widgets end up being very limited in their abilities because too much work has been put into them. This is my first serious venture into Open Source software and wont be the last.

### [Skatebook](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skatebook/id517642215?mt=8)
Behold my first genuine, for-profit, iPhone app. This has been about a 4 month project for me and has been an idea for roughly 1.5 years! As a longboarder I am always wanting to spread the magic and love that is longboarding to others, and one of my best talents is iOS programming. We faced a huge problem trying to communicate about new spots and hills that we would find. I wanted to make an app that would store routes, stats, and basic info about spots that could be shared with others. My first step was to test my market and see who wanted this and who would pay for it. A large percent of people said they'd pay for the app, but most said that they did *not* want the spots to be shared publicly. So I pivoted and setup a project to be entirely private. Spots would only be shared with those in your circles. I used a backend service called [Parse](http://www.parse.com) which was fantastic. I also put about 30 hours of design and UX work into this app and it really paid off.

### [5 Week iOS Workshop](http://whoisryannystrom.com/workshop)
I love teaching people how to do new things. Sometimes that's longboarding, sometimes its how to fly an airplane. I've been on a huge iOS kick lately and have been itching to teach some other people how to get started. I know it was incredibly rough for me to get off the ground running with iOS, so I decided as part of my duties with ACM@UC to run an iOS workshop for five weeks to teach others basics such as Objective-C, using Interface Builder, UI/UX and animations, etc. However this endeavour proved that I had to verse myself in the details of iOS in order to properly teach others. The last thing I wanted to do was to teach some people the wrong things. Throughout the weeks we had about 10-15 people attend each workshop.

### [iOS Presentation](http://www.ceas3.uc.edu/acm/learnings/view/28)
As an officer in the ACM devision at the University of Cincinnati, I helped create the speaking series aptly name the *Ninja Series* which was a series of presentations put on by ambitious students who excelled in a certain topic. I took the reigns and opted to present what I knew about iOS development. The presentation is fairly high-level (which is what it was intended to be). I got several emails from people asking for help and showed several people some basics. The presentation went very well overall with an attendance of about 20 students.

ACM continues to offer great opportunities for students to branch outside of the university's offerings in the world of computing.

Also feel free to take a look at [the slides](http://www.ceas3.uc.edu/acm/assets/files/iOS_Development-1.pdf) and [the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB3FLp-DUs8) of the presentation.

### [ACM @ UC](http://www.ceas3.uc.edu/acm/)

I was asked this year to be the web master for the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) branch at the University of Cincinnati. Just like with the UC Flying Club, we needed to redo all of our site. I rehashed the CMS that I created for the Flying Club and created a seperate layout. We also needed several more modules in the admin section to be able to attach documents, send emails, and even more. I spent about two months creating this site before we deployed it. We are going to be competing for the ACM web competition for the best website for an ACM branch. We are waiting for results to come in.

Just like the Flying Club site, all design, graphics, and coding were done by me alone. It was a daunting requirement at first, but the project turned into an amazing learning experience. We plan on passing the torch to upcomming ACM officers so they can develop and use the site to its fullest.

### [Belt Efficiency Calculator](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/browning-v-belts-efficiency/id389011770?mt=8)
I was finally able to get my hands on an app in the app store while working at <a href="http://topicdesign.com" target="_blank">Topic Design</a>. The original app was coded back in the days of Xcode 3.0 for iOS 3. The app needed updating with more calculators and labels, but I decided that instead of just adding code and smudging up the project, I would rewrite it in iOS 4+ standards. I wasn't able to use the new iOS 5 Automatic Reference Counting, but memory management is important.

The new version of the application is not live yet, but will be coming very soon. Again, the code is proprietary so no open source!

### [Tremolo](http://tremoloapp.com/)

Tremolo is another great app that I took part in while working at <a href="http://topicdesign.com" target="_blank">Topic Design</a>. The app runs on a heavily customized version of jQuery Mobile running on top of CodeIgniter. In the process of making this app, we had several trial runs while developing using different frameworks. I had the opportunity to learn Backbone.js, CouchDB, and CouchApp. Though we scrapped all of that original code, it was an amazing learning experience (as a sidenote, Backbone.js is a <i>great</i> OOP framework for Javascript, highly recommend!).

The app and site are a work in progress.

### [Martian Dice](https://github.com/rnystrom/MartionDemo)

For my senior design project at the University of Cincinnati, my peers and I decided to contact the company <a href="http://playtmg.com/" target="_blank">Tasty Minstrel Games</a> to make an iOS and Android version of their new game <i>Martian Dice</i>. In order to begin making the app, I had to not only teach myself iOS, but also a 2D game engine. In this case I decided to run with Cocos2D. I needed to make 3D sprites that looked like rolling dice. After many hours of struggling, I finally was able to use Blender to make a 3D die model, animate it, break that animation into images, and turn them into a sprite sheet. The entire process was pretty intense, but it was a blast learning. Just this demo alone has turned me into a confident iOS developer and animator.

The code is all open source, no license. None of the code or images will be used in the final product, so feel free to play with it. We do have limited ownership of the Martian Dice IP however, so any attempt to sell this will be in direct violation of Tasty Minstrel Games' license.

Look out for the real version to hit the app store within a couple months!

### [OTR Living Mobile](http://otrliving.com/m/)

I got the opportunity early on while working at <a href="http://topicdesign.com" target="_blank">Topic Design</a> to develope a mobile version of <a href="http://otrliving.com" target="_blank">OTR Living</a>. This task seemed a bit daunting at first, but since I had been working with jQuery Mobile even before I was hired, I decided to use it along with an API written by our developers to pull data off the main site to feed a Javascript powered mobile version. The site is 100% asynchronous and is driven only by Javascript. The app has no hard refreshes or page loads. This improved load time significantly.

No source code for this one! The site is proprietary.

### [Draw With Me](http://whoisryannystrom.com/tests/drawwithme/)

*Draw With Me* is my first real release of a web application. I developed *Draw With Me* for iOS mobile devices and Webkit capable browsers. I got a lot of my inspiration from an experimental developer, <a href="" target="_blank">Mr. Doob</a>. 

In this web app, users are able to connect, all in the same room, and draw together. The drawing functions utilize HTML5's canvas element and Websocket server. Stability is currently a major issue for me. My home desktop is running my Websocket server. Security flaws aside,
I frequently restart and power down my home PC. The problem would be easily solved by purchasing a virtual server, however funds are a bit of a restraint.
*Draw With Me* is one of the first web applications to allow users to draw together on iOS devices. There are currently no applications, both native and web based, that do this. So far I have received significant traffic because of this.The biggest flaw with the app, however, is the
design. I am no designer. However much I independently study web design, I feel I cannot stay on top of modern design trends. Draw With Me is the furthest I have pushed my preplanning abilities to come up with a better design and layout for iPhones and iPads while maintaing a
				similar theme on PC browsers.
                
Currently, the app has been deprecated due to resources. I'm trying to get another server running to support web sockets. You can play with the app now, it's just solo only.

### [Aviation Weather Mobile](http://whoisryannystrom.com/apps/avweather/)

Being a pilot, staying up to date on weather data is most important. <i>Aviation Weather Mobile</i> is a quick and easy way to get airport weather data, either forecasts or in real time, from <a href="http://aviationweather.gov">AviationWeather.gov</a>'s website. I use a simple PHP
HTML lookup class (similar to jQuery) to find the elements I need from the web pages. This is about as close to data mining a government site as I could get!

The other important tool for this app is <a href="http://jqtouch.com/" target="_blank">jQTouch</a>. I like building my apps without APIs so I can have complete control, but sometimes when you want to get somewhere fast, there is no need to reinvent the wheel. To my surprise, jQTouch
is a really well made API! Out of all of the mobile UI Javascript API's that I tested, jQTouch had the best speed and feedback.
