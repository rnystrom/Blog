My Work
============

## Hiring Me

If you've landed here I can only imagine you are looking to add someone to your team. Let me tell you a little about what I'm really good at, what I like doing, and how I do it. For the past several years I have been focusing heavily on **web** and **iOS** development while dabbling in **mobile games**. I am a proponent of **agile** development strategies and stick to a strick regimen of **git** versioning. While I've built a strong understanding of mobile and web technologies, I can adopt new languages and frameworks whenever the task requires it. Please [download a copy](/media/ryannystrom-resume.pdf) of my CV for a professional overview. I'm also trying to push more open source work on [my github](http://github.com/rnystrom) account, so feel free to watch that as well.

### [RNExpandingButtonBar](https://github.com/rnystrom/RNExpandingButtonBar)
This is a simple and lightweight iOS widget that mimics the famous Path 2.0 button. I love the simplicity of the design and wanted something that I, and others, could drag and drop into their projects. It also needed to be highly customizable and *not* do most of the legwork for you. I find that a lot of widgets end up being very limited in their abilities because too much work has been put into them. This is my first serious venture into Open Source software and wont be the last.

### [Skatebook](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skatebook/id517642215?mt=8)
Behold my first genuine, for-profit, iPhone app. This has been about a 4 month project for me and has been an idea for roughly 1.5 years! As a longboarder I am always wanting to spread the magic and love that is longboarding to others, and one of my best talents is iOS programming. We faced a huge problem trying to communicate about new spots and hills that we would find. I wanted to make an app that would store routes, stats, and basic info about spots that could be shared with others. My first step was to test my market and see who wanted this and who would pay for it. A large percent of people said they'd pay for the app, but most said that they did *not* want the spots to be shared publicly. So I pivoted and setup a project to be entirely private. Spots would only be shared with those in your circles. I used a backend service called [Parse](http://www.parse.com) which was fantastic. I also put about 30 hours of design and UX work into this app and it really paid off.

### [5 Week iOS Workshop](http://whoisryannystrom.com/workshop)
I love teaching people how to do new things. Sometimes that's longboarding, sometimes its how to fly an airplane. I've been on a huge iOS kick lately and have been itching to teach some other people how to get started. I know it was incredibly rough for me to get off the ground running with iOS, so I decided as part of my duties with ACM@UC to run an iOS workshop for five weeks to teach others basics such as Objective-C, using Interface Builder, UI/UX and animations, etc. However this endeavour proved that I had to verse myself in the details of iOS in order to properly teach others. The last thing I wanted to do was to teach some people the wrong things. Throughout the weeks we had about 10-15 people attend each workshop.

### [iOS Presentation](http://www.ceas3.uc.edu/acm/learnings/view/28)
As an officer in the ACM devision at the University of Cincinnati, I helped create the speaking series aptly name the *Ninja Series* which was a series of presentations put on by ambitious students who excelled in a certain topic. I took the reigns and opted to present what I knew about iOS development. The presentation is fairly high-level (which is what it was intended to be). I got several emails from people asking for help and showed several people some basics. The presentation went very well overall with an attendance of about 20 students.

ACM continues to offer great opportunities for students to branch outside of the university's offerings in the world of computing.

Also feel free to take a look at [the slides](http://www.ceas3.uc.edu/acm/assets/files/iOS_Development-1.pdf) and [the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB3FLp-DUs8) of the presentation.

### [ACM @ UC](http://www.ceas3.uc.edu/acm/)

I was asked this year to be the web master for the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) branch at the University of Cincinnati. Just like with the UC Flying Club, we needed to redo all of our site. I rehashed the CMS that I created for the Flying Club and created a seperate layout. We also needed several more modules in the admin section to be able to attach documents, send emails, and even more. I spent about two months creating this site before we deployed it. We are going to be competing for the ACM web competition for the best website for an ACM branch. We are waiting for results to come in.

Just like the Flying Club site, all design, graphics, and coding were done by me alone. It was a daunting requirement at first, but the project turned into an amazing learning experience. We plan on passing the torch to upcomming ACM officers so they can develop and use the site to its fullest.

### [Belt Efficiency Calculator](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/browning-v-belts-efficiency/id389011770?mt=8)
I was finally able to get my hands on an app in the app store while working at <a href="http://topicdesign.com" target="_blank">Topic Design</a>. The original app was coded back in the days of Xcode 3.0 for iOS 3. The app needed updating with more calculators and labels, but I decided that instead of just adding code and smudging up the project, I would rewrite it in iOS 4+ standards. I wasn't able to use the new iOS 5 Automatic Reference Counting, but memory management is important.

The new version of the application is not live yet, but will be coming very soon. Again, the code is proprietary so no open source!

### [OTR Living Mobile](http://otrliving.com/m/)

I got the opportunity early on while working at <a href="http://topicdesign.com" target="_blank">Topic Design</a> to develope a mobile version of <a href="http://otrliving.com" target="_blank">OTR Living</a>. This task seemed a bit daunting at first, but since I had been working with jQuery Mobile even before I was hired, I decided to use it along with an API written by our developers to pull data off the main site to feed a Javascript powered mobile version. The site is 100% asynchronous and is driven only by Javascript. The app has no hard refreshes or page loads. This improved load time significantly.

No source code for this one! The site is proprietary.
