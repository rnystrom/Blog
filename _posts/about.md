## about me

Who is **Ryan Nystrom**? I'm a versed web developer, aspiring iOS coder, and hobbyist game dev. Most importantly, I'm an experienced Computer Scientist who loves anything and everything code. I was raised in Vandalia, Ohio where I had an incling for all things math and tech. After graduating high school I moved on to become an urbanite in Cincinnati where I studied at the University of Cincinnati. It was there that I learned the beauty and art that is code. I design, I study, I teach, and I build.

## about this site

This site is intended to serve as a tool to communicate to others what is going on in my head. There are tons of things that I want to share with the world and this way I can put it all out there. Take from it what you can, but tread with caution.

This site is also an example of a statically generated blog. I'm currenly using a project called [secondcrack](https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack) that was created by [Marco Arment](http://twitter.com/marcoarment) (creator of Instapaper). After a lot of research on improving site load times I finally gave in and went with the *old is new* philosphy of statically generated html files. The best part about this site is that it runs on a Linode server which I was able to get Dropbox running on. I can then save files in Markdown on my Dropbox account and they get generated on the server automatically. It's pretty neat.

## contact

I am usually attached to my plethora of Apple products throughout the day. Please email me anytime at <rnystrom@whoisryannystrom.com>, and if I don't respond within 24 hours I am either maimed or impaired.
