For a while now I've been wanting to get back into writing. Getting myself to sit still and focus has been quite a struggle. I spent several days on vacation redesigning my website with the hopes that I would be excited to get back into writing.

However, that didn't happen. I would use the excuse that I was busy, but in reality that just wasn't the case. I have plenty of time that I spend browsing [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) which could easily be used to write and edit.

So instead of making excuses, I'm setting a strict schedule of producing a piece of work every two weeks. That leaves myself a week to write and a week to edit. 

This will be a challenge that will take some discipline, but if I can really get into a groove I'll slowly build up my communication skills. My end goal is to have the confidence to write a small book on iOS development.

As with most of my work, this entire site is hosted [on Github](https://github.com/rnystrom/Blog). If you ever find a correction that needs to be made, please submit a pull request.
