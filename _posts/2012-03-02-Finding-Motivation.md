title: "Finding Motivation"
---

I often find myself having a *lot* of cool ideas. Sometimes I think they could even make me some money, which would be awesome. However, I have the biggest problem of motivating myself to get off my ass and actually do something. It's difficult, especially when I am reading and listening to development gurus who have had their success and sound relatively lazy nowadays (that isn't saying that they didn't earn their lifestyle and status).

I'm proud of what I've accomplished thus far, but there is more to do. The sky's the limit.
