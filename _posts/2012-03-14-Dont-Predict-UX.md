title: "Don't Predict UX"
---

With the advent of the new iPad comes an update to iOS. The newest version is iOS 5.1 which brings some subtle changes. One of my favorite changes is that if you open mobile Safari without having any other pages open, that annoying bookmark doesn't pop up anymore. I'm sure some people utilized it, but I know a fair majority found it annoying. It just got in the way because it was just one extra touch needed to get to what you most likely wanted.

This is just an example of UX prediction. Apple thought that the user would *want* to look at their bookmarks more than go straight to a Google search or URL. User feedback was enough for them to change it back.

Bottom line is this: when designing your UI/UX, avoid shortcuts thinking that its what your users want. Do the extra work if they start complaining about a non-intuitive UI.
