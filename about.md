I am a passionate mobile developer currently living in Columbus, Ohio. Most of my days are spent at [Dynamit](http://dynamit.us) in downtown Columbus where I run our up-and-coming mobile development. I've been making native and web apps since 2008, when I was in school at the [University of Cincinnati](http://uc.edu).

### Learning

Outside of my day job I create apps for learning experiences. I've been a wishful entrepreneur for some time now, and every app I release is an experiment in marketing, engineering, and design (I've managed to get an [app](http://poetreatapp.com/) featured on the App Store). My goal is to create a sustainable side-gig to slowly scale and experiment with even further.

I also like to invest a good deal of time into open source projects on [Github](https://github.com/rnystrom. I feel an ethical obligation to contribute software back into the wild as much of what I use was born from free and open collaberation on the web.

I frequently challenge myself by [designing](http://ryannystrom.dunked.com) my own native and web mobile apps. Design has been incredibly challenging but very rewarding for myself, my business, and my coworkers.

### Writing

I try to write as much as I can because writing is one of the best ways to get better at critical thinking and organization. Writing is also one of the more difficult tasks for me, always has been.

I am a [tech editor](http://www.raywenderlich.com/about#rnystrom) for [RayWenderlich.com](http://raywenderlich.com/), the most popular and vast iOS tutorial websites out there. I get to work with incredibly talented developers and writers while also learning about ground-breaking technologies all at the same time. It's amazing.
